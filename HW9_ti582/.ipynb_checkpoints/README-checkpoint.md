# PUI 2018 HW #9

This is the README file for my HW9 assignment. I worked on the entirety of the HW9 assignment alone.

## Assignment 1

For this assignment, I reviewed Vivaldi Rinaldi's and Xiao Jing's plots. Vivaldi's plot review can be found in my "var287_plotReview_ti582.md" file and Xiao's review can be found in my "xj655_plotReview_ti582.md" file. I forked Vivaldi's and Xiao's repo's and uploaded my Markdown review files to the forked HW8 folder. I then submitted pull requests. 

## Assignment 2

Refer to my "HW9_A2_TI.ipynb" file.

## Assignment 3

Refer to my "HW9_A3_TI.ipynb" file.
