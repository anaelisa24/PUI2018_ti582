# PUI 2018 HW #8

This is the README file for my HW8 assignment. I worked on the entirety of the HW8 assignment alone.

## Assignment 1

**Figure 1**: The plot above shows locations of senior centers (blue dots) and neighborhood slow zones (red shaded areas) as provided by the Vision Zero team from NYC DOT. They are plotted on top of the NYC PUMA areas. There does not seem to be a correlation between the locations of the senior centers and the neighborhood slow zones.

The code used to generate the plot in Figure 1 can be found in my "HW8_A1_TI.ipynb" file.
## Assignment 2

My assignment is composed of two parts:
1. My Authorea article file: https://www.authorea.com/335996/C13udCDgUajkH__IEREv9g
2. My jupyter notebook file: "HW8_A2_TI.ipynb"
