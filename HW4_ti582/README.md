# PUI 2018 HW #4

This is the README file for my HW4 assignment. I worked on the entirety of the HW4 assignment alone.

## Assignment 1

Refer to my "A1_TI.ipynb" file. For this assignment, I followed the 'Assignment1.ipynb' file on Dr. Bianco's GitHub repository as a template for setting up the distributions. I created 5 different distributions and plotted the data.

## Assignment 2

Refer to my "A2_TI.ipynb" file. For this assignment, I downloaded Citibike data and formulate a null and alternative hypothesis to be tested at a later date.

## Assignment 3

Refer to my "A3_TI.ipynb" file. For this assignment, I performed a statistical test on bus trip duration data in order to determine whether my hypthoeses are statistically significant or not.
