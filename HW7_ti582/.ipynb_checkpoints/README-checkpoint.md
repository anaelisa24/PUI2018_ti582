# PUI 2018 HW #7

This is the README file for my HW7 assignment. I worked on the entirety of the HW7 assignment alone.

My assignment is contained within my 'HW7_TI.ipynb' file. 

NOTE: I have created a python file, 'censusAPI.py', which has a function called myAPI. That function takes one argument, which is the name of a text file. In order to ensure compatability with my notebook, please name your text file 'censusTextFile.txt'. I have purposely not uploaded my 'censusTextFile.txt' file because it has my API key in it. The contents of your 'censusTextFile.txt' file should be your own census API key.
